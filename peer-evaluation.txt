Project: Space Shooter
Peer's repository: https://github.com/sabdllah/05-Space-Shooter.git



What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?
You are able to set the sprite lists to None when you initialize them without any problems.
 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
They make good use of the random library, something that is lacking from my game
 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
Comment out your code, and try to implement some sort of win/lose state in a game such as this
 

What could have been clearer or better commented?
There were very few comments throughout the code, the program would have been very hard to understand for someone who was unfamilliar with the arcade library
.
Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
I was somewhat confused as to why he initialized the spritelists twice, once in the __init__ function of the MyGame class and once in the setup method. I would think that they would only need to be initialized during either of these methods, but not both
Also I am confused as to why they are initialized as None in the __init__ method as opposed to arcade.SpriteList()
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
Yes
 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
Be more clear on which python file to run
 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
Your code is clear and concise, it makes sense and follows a logical flow
